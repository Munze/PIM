# Product Information Management (PIM) System Documentation

## Objective
Develop a Product Information Management (PIM) System to ingest, manage, and export product data from multiple sources, including supplier feeds and manually entered products. The system should support real-time search, data enrichment, product comparison, and integration with external systems (e.g., CMS). It must include a scheduling feature for automated tasks such as feed updates and export generation.

## Key Functionalities

### Data Ingestion and Normalization
- Ingest supplier feeds in XML, JSON, or CSV formats via API, FTP, or file upload.
- Schedule feed updates (e.g., hourly, daily) and support manual refreshes.
- Normalize and map supplier feed fields to internal schema using a customizable field mapping tool.

### Local Product Management
- Provide a database table (`local_products`) for manually entered or overridden product data.
- Allow users to:
  - Add products missing from supplier feeds.
  - Edit supplier-provided data (e.g., custom pricing, descriptions).
  - Manage images (select supplier-provided images or upload custom ones).

### Field Mapping and Transformation
- Build a UI for defining mappings between supplier feed fields and internal fields.
- Support transformation rules (e.g., concatenation, unit conversion).
- Store field mappings for each supplier in a database (`field_mappings`).

### Search and Query
- Enable searching by EAN, MPN, and supplier_product_code across both supplier and local data.
- Support advanced filters for fields like stock availability, price range, and product categories.

### Product Comparison
- Compare data for the same product from multiple suppliers (e.g., price, stock, description).
- Allow users to select preferred attributes for export.

### Validation and Data Quality
- Implement a validation system to:
  - Highlight missing mandatory fields (e.g., EAN, price).
  - Apply custom validation rules (e.g., price must be positive).
- Provide a dashboard for reviewing and resolving validation errors.

### Image Management
- Fetch image URLs from supplier feeds and display them in the UI.
- Allow users to:
  - Select preferred images for export.
  - Upload local images if supplier images are missing.

### Export System
- Generate export feeds in JSON, XML, or CSV formats.
- Allow users to define custom export schemas for CMS integration.
- Merge supplier and local product data during export, with local data taking precedence in case of conflicts.

### Task Scheduling
- Implement a scheduling system to automate tasks like feed updates, validation, and export generation.
- Allow admins to:
  - Create, edit, and disable scheduled tasks.
  - Define schedules using cron-like expressions (e.g., daily at 2 AM).
- Log task executions and errors for auditing.

### User Management
- Role-based access control (e.g., admins, editors).
- Maintain audit logs for changes made to product data.

## System Architecture

### Backend
- **Language**: Node.js running in Docker.
- **Database**: MySQL for structured data.
- **File Storage**: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or local server for storing images and raw feeds.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js for a responsive and performant UI with server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities.
- **Features**:
  - Field mapping and transformation tool.
  - Product search, comparison, and editing interfaces.
  - Image management module.

### ETL Pipeline
- Automate extraction, transformation, and loading of supplier data.
- Support both batch and real-time updates.

### Scheduler
- Use Celery or APScheduler for scheduling and managing tasks.
- Store scheduling configurations in a `scheduled_tasks` table.

### API Integration
- Provide REST APIs for querying products, exporting data, and integrating with external systems.

## Database Design

### Tables
- `supplier_feeds`: Store raw data from supplier feeds for reference.
- `local_products`: Store manually entered or overridden product data.
- `field_mappings`: Map supplier-specific fields to internal schema.
- `export_schemas`: Define custom export formats.
- `scheduled_tasks`: Manage automation schedules for tasks.
- `task_logs`: Track task execution history.
- `products`: Unified view combining supplier and local data.
- `product_images`: Manage multiple images per product.
- `validation_rules`: Define and enforce data quality checks.

### Key Relationships
- Link `local_products` and `supplier_feeds` to `products` for merging.
- Link `product_images` to both `local_products` and `products`.

## Detailed User Stories

### Data Ingestion
- As an admin, I can upload supplier feeds or configure APIs for automated ingestion.
- As an admin, I can define field mappings for each supplier and preview transformed data.

### Search and Comparison
- As an editor, I can search products by EAN, MPN, or supplier_product_code across all sources.
- As an editor, I can compare attributes from multiple suppliers and select the preferred values.

### Manual Product Entry
- As an editor, I can add products that are missing in supplier feeds.
- As an editor, I can edit and override supplier-provided data.

### Image Management
- As an editor, I can preview and select product images from supplier feeds.
- As an editor, I can upload custom images for products.

### Export
- As an admin, I can define custom export schemas and generate feeds in JSON, XML, or CSV formats.

### Validation
- As an admin, I can configure validation rules (e.g., mandatory fields) and flag invalid data.

### Scheduling
- As an admin, I can schedule feed updates, validation, and export tasks.
- As an admin, I can view execution logs for all scheduled tasks.

## Deliverables

### Web Application
- Full-stack PIM system with the described features.

### API Documentation
- REST API for querying, updating, and exporting product data.

### Database Schema
- Optimized for supplier feeds, local products, and field mappings.

### Scheduling System
- Backend scheduler with task management and execution logs.

### UI Mockups
- Interfaces for field mapping, product comparison, image selection, and scheduling.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure scalability for large product catalogs (e.g., millions of products).
- Provide flexibility to add new suppliers and data formats without major changes.
- Prioritize user experience with intuitive interfaces for non-technical users.
